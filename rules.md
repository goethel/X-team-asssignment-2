# X-Team 013 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
 During the initial phases, Volunteering with be used, with preference given to important methods that are dependencies of other methods. After that, volunteering will still be used unless no one wants to do the method.
  
  Reassigning will be done through meetings /group message as needed


## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Using Github, and putting in the commit description our progress on that file
Also letting people know on group message when you make a major change finish.




## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will communicate our differenes through our weekly meetings if we are stuck on a method. Also through group message if it is in between meetings and we still need to get the information out. 

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Pair programming if a difficult method/class comes up, in person at a meeting.
Bringing bugs/roadblocks to attention ASAP so work on your portion can continue smoothly

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Let us know if you need to miss or are late to a meeting


Meeting at an assigned time every week to prevent missing meetings
